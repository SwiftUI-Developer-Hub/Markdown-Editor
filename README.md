# Markdown Editor
**Markdown Editor** is a tool for creating and editing Markdown files (`.md`, `.mkdn` formats).  
It helps you write structured content using simple syntaxâ€”ideal for documentation, notes, and more.

## What's Working
- All toolbar buttons are functional and insert the correct Markdown syntax.
- Live preview of the Markdown code works.
- Basic editing functionality is in place.

## What's Broken
- Toggle formatting based on text selection does not work.
- Undo/Redo behavior is unreliable (undo manager not yet implemented).

## What's Missing
- Undo manager for tracking and reverting text changes.
