**Markdown Editor** is a tool for creating and editing Markdown files (`.md`, `.mkdn` formats).  
It helps you write structured content using simple syntaxâ€”ideal for documentation, notes, and more.

## What's Working
- Multi-file support.
- Live preview of the Markdown code works.
- Basic editing functionality is in place.
- Undo/Redo behavior is functioning properly.
- **Clear formatted for selected text works**, clearing the applied styles.
- All toolbar buttons are functional and insert the correct Markdown syntax.

## What's Broken
- Image size is not supported in the Markdown UI.
- Spell checking on right-click causes index out of bounds.
- Synced scrolling between editor and preview does not work properly.

## What's Missing
- More Developer.
- Translate select Word.
- Static String translations.
