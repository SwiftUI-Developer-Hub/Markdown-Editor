**Markdown Editor** is a tool for creating and editing Markdown files (`.md`, `.mkdn` formats).  
It helps you write structured content using simple syntax—ideal for documentation, notes, and more.

## What's Working
- All toolbar buttons are functional and insert the correct Markdown syntax.
- Live preview of the Markdown code works.
- Basic editing functionality is in place.
- Undo/Redo behavior

## What's Broken
- Image size is not supported in the Markdown UI.
- Synced scrolling between editor and preview does not work properly.

## What's Missing
- Multi-file support.
- Toggle formatting based on text selection does not work.
